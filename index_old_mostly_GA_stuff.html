              <p>John was one of my teachers assistants at General Assembly, and was an irreplaceable asset to my learning. If he didn't know the answer immediately, he would help us de-bug and we would work through the problem together. As students, we always felt confident going to John for any assistance.</p>
              </p>Tech skills aside, John is an incredibly supportive, generous, and fun person to be around. He always knew what to say to make me feel more confident, and was always willing to stay back after hours to help whoever was in need. He is incredibly patient, and his communication skills in terms of explaining complex ideas to people without a tech background improved dramatically over the 3 months he was our teachers assistant.</p>
              </p>John is the type of developer that is easy to get along with and communicate with, and I believe 100% that John would be a strong asset to any development team.</p>

              <p>John had the unenviable task of presenting exercises to, and debugging for, 23 code newbies, some of whom didn’t know how to table a question. This he accomplished with patience, wisdom and good humour. It’s my belief that John would be an asset to any team!</p>

              <p>John was the teaching assistant for our Web Development Immersive course at GA. He provided me with excellent assistance and guidance throughout my course, both because he had a good understanding of the difficult concepts we were covering and because he was always approachable and friendly. I think John would make an excellent developer and co-worker. He is friendly, funny, and easy to communicate with.</p>
              <p>When I came to John with bugs or blockers for my projects, or had difficulties in picking up the concepts we were learning, he was able to easily and quickly get to the heart of what I was having a problem with. I can't recall a single time that he wasn't able to help me fix whatever problem I was having or help me get a deeper and clearer understanding of the concept we were learning that day. John will be an asset wherever he ends up.</p>

                <p>John is also very experienced with debugging as he the that all 26 members of our class approached for help in debugging our code. Every. Single. Day. And he was able to help us with a lot of our problems. He an exceptional problem solver, and even in the times where he couldn't figure out a solution to one of my problems on the spot, he would go off and research, experiment until he comes back with a solution. John would never let a problem beat him.</p>
                <p>Besides John's skills and experience, he also has a lot of personal qualities. He is able to effectively translate very difficult concepts to the complete beginner. He has an admirable amount of patience which I have tried and tested throughout my journey at GA. John was also my go to person when I was having self doubts, when I was panicking over silly things - John would be there to reassure me and that was one of the biggest drives that enabled me to get through GA.</p>

                <p>I was very fortunate to have John as our teaching assistant during my time at GA’s Web Development Immersive Course. He was approachable and had excellent communication skills. I would often come to John for help whenever I struggled with anything and sure enough he helped me work through it. He has a strong understanding of programming concepts which made him excellent at explaining back to us.</p>
                <p>He was very patient and empathetic. This course wasn’t a cake walk and he provided support and encouragement to many of us which I believe was a contributing factor to people’s success in the course.</p>
                <p>I think that John is a great team player with excellent people skills. He would do very well in any team.</p>

                <p>I had the pleasure of meeting John as part of my Web Dev immersive course at General Assembly batch 28 and him as a TA. During the time of the course, John was always very supportive, technically and psychologically, two of the core aspects needed to successfully finish a very intensive endeavour. It was key to have him around for those crucial moments of lapses, where nothing makes sense anymore and the existential questions are constantly present, every day, every hour. John has an acute sense of empathy and concern for all the fellows aspiring Web Developers, he also plays the guitar.</p>

                <p>John was my Teacher’s Assistant when I was studying web development at General Assembly. John was incredibly empathetic, supportive and patient with all students in the class. Through his passion and dedication to his role as a TA, I was inspired and motivated throughout the course. </p>
                <p>When I had difficulties completing a programming task or project, John would provide guidance and encouraged me to solve the problem independently via pair programming or asking me to explain my thought process whilst solving the problem together. I felt that this approach accelerated my learning progress and taught me how to think and solve problems as a programmer. He is approachable, friendly and always keen for a good laugh! I would recommend John to any team that requires a dedicated and passionate developer with strong communication skills.</p>
