          <p>Hi, I'm John Coote. In the past I've worked as an Electrical Engineer and a Recruiter and now I am making a mid career change into web development.</p>
          <p>I am seeking a web developer position in Sydney  in either full stack or back end development. I'm open to any kind of work environment that will allow me to further develop my skills.</p>
          <p>Outside of my work life I'm a father, an enthusiastic but not very good cricketer, a beginner banjo player and an unlucky fisherman.</p>

              <p>John was one of my teachers assistants at General Assembly, and was an irreplaceable asset to my learning. If he didn't know the answer immediately, he would help us de-bug and we would work through the problem together. As students, we always felt confident going to John for any assistance.</p>
              </p>Tech skills aside, John is an incredibly supportive, generous, and fun person to be around. He always knew what to say to make me feel more confident, and was always willing to stay back after hours to help whoever was in need. He is incredibly patient, and his communication skills in terms of explaining complex ideas to people without a tech background improved dramatically over the 3 months he was our teachers assistant.</p>
              </p>John is the type of developer that is easy to get along with and communicate with, and I believe 100% that John would be a strong asset to any development team.</p>

              <p>I had the pleasure of having John as a Teaching Assistant while studying Web Development at General Assembly.</p>
              <p>John had the unenviable task of presenting exercises to, and debugging for, 23 code newbies, some of whom didn’t know how to table a question. This he accomplished with patience, wisdom and good humour. It’s my belief that John would be an asset to any team!</p>

              <p>John is a very passionate developer. His communication skills are excellent at his appetite for more knowledge is inspiring. Also his ability to adapt to new technologies make him a delight to work with.
              John is, without doubt, the most helpful teacher that any student can have.</p>

              <h2>Katrina Hayes - GA WDI Alumni</h2>
              <p>John was the teaching assistant for our Web Development Immersive course at GA. He provided me with excellent assistance and guidance throughout my course, both because he had a good understanding of the difficult concepts we were covering and because he was always approachable and friendly. I think John would make an excellent developer and co-worker. He is friendly, funny, and easy to communicate with.</p>
              <p>When I came to John with bugs or blockers for my projects, or had difficulties in picking up the concepts we were learning, he was able to easily and quickly get to the heart of what I was having a problem with. I can't recall a single time that he wasn't able to help me fix whatever problem I was having or help me get a deeper and clearer understanding of the concept we were learning that day. John will be an asset wherever he ends up.</p>

                <p>John is also very experienced with debugging as he the that all 26 members of our class approached for help in debugging our code. Every. Single. Day. And he was able to help us with a lot of our problems. He an exceptional problem solver, and even in the times where he couldn't figure out a solution to one of my problems on the spot, he would go off and research, experiment until he comes back with a solution. John would never let a problem beat him.</p>
                <p>Besides John's skills and experience, he also has a lot of personal qualities. He is able to effectively translate very difficult concepts to the complete beginner. He has an admirable amount of patience which I have tried and tested throughout my journey at GA. John was also my go to person when I was having self doubts, when I was panicking over silly things - John would be there to reassure me and that was one of the biggest drives that enabled me to get through GA.</p>
