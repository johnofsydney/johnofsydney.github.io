 <i>Over the past 20 years I have had working experience with many software packages and can confirm that Pipeline more than exceeds my expectation. DataHouseSoftware are extremely in tune with their clients needs and when refinement of the software is required they are both receptive and responsive, the technical support is second to none. In summary, DataHouseSoftware provide a great initial package that shows intuition and understanding of the clients industry, and remain both approachable and organic with regards to ongoing refinement and development as needs grow and change. They have proved invaluable to our business and I recommend them without hesitation.</i><BR>

<i> I have been searching for recruitment software for many years that is both simple to use and has the detailed search capability of identifying my clients and candidates in a way that we could design ourselves.  Pipeline is the most user friendly, intuitive system I have found in the 12 years I have been in recruitment. It has been designed specifically for the use of the recruiter and not HR in mind. We have found that data entry takes seconds to upload contacts and client details and the keyword search capability is as detailed as you want it to be.  The add on features such as the pipeline of interviews and the ability to align candidates up to float into clients allows us to track all of the necessary activity.<br>
<BR>
I can honestly say that the back end service we have received from DataHouseSoftware has been exceptional and anyone thinking of purchasing new recruitment software to help their business grow then this software is the ideal purchase.  There are too many products on the market with all the un-necessary bells and whistles that quite frankly are a waste of time. We want our software to capture the relevant information and allow us to do what we do best in the day, which is talk to our client and candidates, not spending all day working out the database. I would be more than happy for anyone to contact me to discuss the benefits of Pipeline for their business. <br></I>

<I>We have recently set up a new specialist consulting firm and elected to utilize Pipeline, following a trial period proposed by John Coote. Having previous experience in the recruitment industry along with professional industry experience has enabled John to understand implicitly, the intricate system we would require to maximize our productivity levels. Pipeline's ability to meet our specific needs superseded our expectations, resulting in a system which we believe gives us an edge over our competitors.<br><br>
We look forward to John’s continued support during our National growth and development in this challenging market. <br>

<I>I researched quite a few databases. I was used to working with adapt and voyager. I decided to go with Pipeline as it has been designed especially for recruitment agencies so it has all the day to day functions I was used to plus it helps with the financial side including invoicing and wages. It is very user friendly and it was extremely affordable. If I have had any questions John has always been at the other end of the phone to help.<BR></I>

<I>After an Australia wide search, for a recruitment database, we decided to purchase Pipeline which we determined would fulfil our business requirements in a cost effective manner. The service we have received from John Coote at Data House Software is second to none. John was able to install the system remotely in the first instance and has continually offered this service for installation of updates. John is easily contacted and offers technical assistance promptly and efficiently. The database itself is user friendly and has been a valuable asset to the recruitment side of our business.<BR></I>
