Sales are the whole point of being in business. Your company needs to know exactly what is happening with each sale. Effective reporting on sales is of vital importance to help you target you efforts towards your best customers.<BR>
<BR>
Your Sales Order Entry needs to be fast and efficient and your invoicing must be clear and concise. The net result being you spend less time and money entering orders and your customers find it easier to pay you promptly.<BR>
<BR>
Your sales reporting needs to be comprehensive. The success of your business depends upon knowing who your best customers are, what countries your business is strongest in, and which are your most profitable products. You can't afford to guess these things, and nor can you afford to spend days or weeks trying to work them out.<BR>
<BR>
DataHouse offers two main tools for sales orders and invoicing; the first is the Sales Order data entry screen where you can enter details about the order and print a copy of the invoice, and the second is the reports available to help you target your efforts towards your best customers.<BR>
<BR>
In the data entry screen you select the customer from a list, and all their details such as Company and address are filled in automatically. No time is wasted finding information or writing it out again. Similarly you select products from a list, and then simply assign a quantity and a sell price to each. Salesperson, Currency and Terms are also all selected from their own lists. Then at the click of a button your invoice is prepared ready to print and send to your customer. If you are converting a previous quotation into an order, you simply need to enter the sale date, and the due dates for delivery and payment.<BR>
<BR>
The other main tool is the reporting available on your sales. You can only target your best customers and future sales opportunities opportunities when you really know who, what and where they are. DataHouse provides a comprehensive set of reports on all sales between two dates that you specify, allowing you to analyse data by Customer, Country, Date and Product Group.<BR>
